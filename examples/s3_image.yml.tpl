# these params will add up to your a3 uri to protect enviroment clashes of ids and images

# only deployed_to is optional, it won't show in the uri if it's omitted
# we have yet to implement a rake task that would change uris if you change namespace, at this point this is rather
# fixed so think about this before you start using this plugin
